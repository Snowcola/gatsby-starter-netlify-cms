Equipment(starts at free)

* Use what you have you can upgrade later, your phone, gaming headset can be a good starting point
* USB microphones like the Blue Yeti are a good next step. Get a pop filter.
* Real swanky recording equipment if things take off: condenser mics, audio interfaces, shure sm-7b

Software(free)

* Audacity
* Some podcast hosts also have free editing tools as well (Anchor.fm)
* Export as flac
* Hosting(free - ~$5/month)

Audio Hosting

* Soundcloud (can host 3 hours of podcasts for free)
* Anchor.fm totally free right now but probably wont always be that way

Web Hosting

* Github + Netlify CMS (runs on Gatsby.js, some webdev knowledge required) completely free
* Wordpress, Squarespace is a good secondary option can be had for free if you are willing to self host or for a small monthly fee ~$5 if you would rather just pay someone
