Show Notes:

* Cyphertext: coded message, plaintext: decoded message
* Language is a code: hieroglyphics
* Morse Code
* Classic ciphers (pen and paper) pre WWII:
* * Transposition cypher
  * Shift cypher: caesar
  * Substitution cyphers

    * â€œPIG PEN Cipher 
  * Monoalphabetic:
  * Polyalphabetic:
  * Vigenere Cypher 
* One time pads
* Enigma machine
* Digital cryptography:
* * Binary and bit manipulations: bit twiddle, AND/OR/XOR
  * Key distribution, the problem all ciphers have
  * RSA
  * Pretty Good Privacy (PGP):
  * Digital Signing
  * Hashing: MD5, Bcrypt, SHA, AGRON2, etc

    * [Description of some hashing algorithms](https://www.streetdirectory.com/etoday/what-is-the-strongest-hash-algorithm-ejcluw.html)

Stay tuned for part 2, where we discuss our favorite unsolved cyphers.
