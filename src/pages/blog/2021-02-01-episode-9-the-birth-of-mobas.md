  Greg and Anto talk about the birth of the MOBA video game genre. Where did
  popular games like League of Legends, DOTA 2, Heroes of the Storm and Smite
  come from? What other games spun off in this way? We go back to Warcraft III
  and relive the good ol' days.

We discuss the road to MOBAs and the different games created along the way

* Warcraft 3
  * Custom maps - community made
  * DOTA
  * Legion TD + other Mauls and TDs
  * Angel Arena
* Heroes of Newearth
* League of Legends - Riot Games
* Dota 2 - Valve
* Heroes of the Storm - Blizzard
* Chinese Ripoffs: mobile legends
* Warcraft 3 reforged: Blizzardâ€™s reaction - all custom maps made with editor belong to

And then it happened again: Dota 2 community: auto chess -> League of Legends TFT
